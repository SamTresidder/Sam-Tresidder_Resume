                    <li>Proposed and developed project to overhaul campaign developer pre-
                        defined filters. This involved: eliminating outdated/unused filters,
                        updating relevant outdated filters and creating new filters to increase
                        efficiency in campaign creation, saving approximately 3.5 hrs. per
                        week.</li>
                    <li>Implemented use of test plans for campaign self/peer review. Results
                        seen were reduction in review time and a drop in number of edits,
                        equating to approximately 2 hrs. per week. This also allowed the team
                        to accomplish 99-100% accuracy goal on all campaigns (roughly 15-
                        20 weekly across all channels).</li>
                    <li>Lead twice daily stand-ups to align team on priorities. generating

                    <li>Initiated collaboration between stakeholders to implement expedited
                        schedules for holidays that satisfied all parties. This eliminated 100%
                        of occurrences where campaigns were pushed due to teams failing to
                        meet deadlines.</li>
                    <li>Proactively used knowledge of customer file to make
                        recommendations on how to reach target quantities across campaigns
                        without compromising quality of the targeted segments and individual
